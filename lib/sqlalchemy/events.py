class DDLEvents(event.Events):
    """
    Define event listeners for schema objects,
    that is, :class:`.SchemaItem` and :class:`.SchemaEvent`
    subclasses, including :class:`.MetaData`, :class:`.Table`,
    :class:`.Column`.
    
    :class:`.MetaData` and :class:`.Table` support events
    specifically regarding when CREATE and DROP
    DDL is emitted to the database.  
    
    Attachment events are also provided to customize
    behavior whenever a child schema element is associated
    with a parent, such as, when a :class:`.Column` is associated
    with its :class:`.Table`, when a :class:`.ForeignKeyConstraint`
    is associated with a :class:`.Table`, etc.

    Example using the ``after_create`` event::

        from sqlalchemy import event
        from sqlalchemy import Table, Column, Metadata, Integer

        m = MetaData()
        some_table = Table('some_table', m, Column('data', Integer))

        def after_create(target, connection, **kw):
            connection.execute("ALTER TABLE %s SET name=foo_%s" % 
                                    (target.name, target.name))

        event.listen(some_table, "after_create", after_create)

    DDL events integrate closely with the 
    :class:`.DDL` class and the :class:`.DDLElement` hierarchy
    of DDL clause constructs, which are themselves appropriate 
    as listener callables::

        from sqlalchemy import DDL
        event.listen(
            some_table,
            "after_create",
            DDL("ALTER TABLE %(table)s SET name=foo_%(table)s")
        )

    The methods here define the name of an event as well
    as the names of members that are passed to listener
    functions.
